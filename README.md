# Tips for Strong Passwords:
- Use at least 12–16 characters
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Avoid common words or phrases
- Don't reuse old passwords
- Prefer passphrases like: Blue$Sky!Run@Fast#123


# Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. What makes a password strong?
A strong password is one that:
- Is at least 12–16 characters long
- Contains a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols
- Avoids dictionary words, names, or predictable sequences
- Is not reused across multiple accounts

## 2. What are common password attacks?
Common types of password attacks include:
- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all possible combinations until the correct one is found.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses a list of commonly used passwords and words to guess the password.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Uses leaked credentials from one site to access accounts on other sites.
- **Phishing**: Tricks the user into revealing their password through fake emails or websites.
- **Keylogging**: Captures everything typed on a keyboard, including passwords.

## 3. Why is password length important?
Password length significantly increases security. Each additional character exponentially increases the total number of possible combinations, making brute-force attacks take much longer. A longer password is generally more secure than a shorter, more complex one.

## 4. What is a dictionary attack?
A dictionary attack is a method where attackers use a predefined list of words (like in a dictionary) and common passwords to guess user credentials. It is faster than brute-force and effective against weak or common passwords.

## 5. What is multi-factor authentication?
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security process that requires more than one method of authentication. For example:
- Something you know (password)
- Something you have (OTP or hardware token)
- Something you are (fingerprint or facial recognition)

It adds an extra layer of security beyond just the password.

## 6. How do password managers help?
Password managers:
- Generate strong, unique passwords for each account
- Store passwords securely using encryption
- Auto-fill login forms safely
- Help users avoid reusing passwords or forgetting them

Examples: Bitwarden, LastPass, 1Password, KeePass

## 7. What are passphrases?
Passphrases are sequences of random or meaningful words strung together to form a password. They are:
- Easier to remember
- Harder to crack
- Often longer than typical passwords

Example: `Sunlight$Tree!Monkey#Banana`

## 8. What are common mistakes in password creation?
Some common mistakes include:
- Using simple or guessable passwords (e.g., `123456`, `qwerty`)
- Including personal information (e.g., name, birthdate)
- Reusing the same password across websites
- Not updating passwords after a breach
- Writing passwords in insecure locations
